I really enjoyed working on this project. This was my first foray into creating a legitamently function product.
It was really fun to create something that I could see myself using, and I'm happy how it turned out both functionally, and aesthetically.

I plan to polish up this project a little bit in the future.

To Do:
- Improve appearance on narrower aspect ratio devices.
- Utilize localStorage
